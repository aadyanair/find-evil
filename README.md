# Find-Evil: AI-Powered DFIR Investigation Agent

## Overview

Find-Evil is an AI-driven Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) assistant that automates memory dump investigations using Volatility 3 and LangGraph.

The system analyzes memory artifacts, evaluates suspicious activity, selects appropriate forensic plugins, executes investigations, and generates a structured forensic report.

## Problem Statement

Memory forensics investigations often require analysts to manually inspect multiple Volatility outputs and determine the next investigative step.

This process can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on analyst experience.

Find-Evil assists investigators by:

* Collecting forensic artifacts
* Scoring suspicious activity
* Reasoning about findings
* Selecting investigation plugins automatically
* Generating investigation reports

## Features

### Process Analysis

* Parses Volatility process listings
* Identifies suspicious processes
* Calculates suspicion scores

### Network Analysis

* Parses Volatility netscan output
* Detects listening services
* Detects network communication artifacts

### Investigation Reasoning

* Explains why processes are suspicious
* Generates human-readable reasoning

### Automated Plugin Selection

Based on observed evidence, the agent automatically selects an appropriate Volatility plugin.

Examples:

* windows.cmdline
* windows.netscan

### Report Generation

Generates structured investigation reports containing:

* Process findings
* Network findings
* Suspicion score
* Investigation reasoning
* Plugin output preview
